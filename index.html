					<p>
						First I just wanted to try make a grid of my own, so I made some research as to how other grids are made and based Grid on the things I liked with other grids. Features like the different sizings, and since I had just started using Sass I wanted some inspiration for how things could be done nicely.

				<div class="col-6 col-sm-12">
					<p>
						Then I noticed that most of the grids I found that I liked the most have started with a mobile first approach and in most cases this is not how I work. Not because I don't want to but because most of the times I get a desktop design first and then the tablet and mobile versions happens along the way with somewhat of a mobile design maybe turning up along the way.
